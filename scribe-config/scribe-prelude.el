;;; scribe-prelude.el --- overrides and adjustments to Prelude

;;; commentary:

;; this only matters if you use prelude.  Disable/enable as needed
;; by un-commenting what you need.

;;; ----------------- Prelude Disabling ----------------------
;;; ----------------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  I suggest you use Prelude.  However, I also suggest you
;;  you disable some of the defaults it comes with to make
;;  your life as a prose writer a little more intuitive.
;;  If you DO use Prelude, simply un-comment the lines you
;;  want to disable.
